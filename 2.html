  <p>The zerg performed their function as I planned... My Hybrid are proof of this. Now, the last of the protoss will fulfill their function... <strong><u>In death!</u></strong></p>
  <p>As I was your beginning - so shall I be... your end.</p>
  <p>Foolish, prideful children... <br>
    There was one among you who could have jeopardized my great plan... <br>
    but in your recklessness <strong>you mistook her for the true threat!</strong>
  <p>I love it when a plan comes together.</p>
  <p>Your lives are meaningless, purposeless. I grant you salvation!</p>
  <p>All life is broken... flawed. It must be reforged.</p>
  <p>Behold, the form of your god. The culmination of a cycle set into motion when the stars were born.</p>
  <p>Do you seek deliverance within these empty halls? You will find none here. Only the truth of the Xel'naga's failure. I offer a gift. Release in oblivion./<p>
  <p>Know the truth, Artanis: your people, your beliefs, your Khala... everything, a lie. There is nothing left of you.</p>
  <p>I will remake this universe as It should have been... perfect.</p>
