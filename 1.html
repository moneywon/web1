  <p>Today we <strong>retake our <u>homeworld</u>. And with it, our <u>legacy</u>!!</strong></P>
  <p style="margin-top:60px;">Countless lives lost! There will be more bloodshed in this invasion. More friends fallen. Because we cling to an ideal that may have passed.</P>
  <p>My will is not so easily broken, Amon. The firstborn shall fear you no longer!!</p>
  My brethren, <a href="https://namu.wiki/" target="blank" title="all of knowledge">hear me!</a> For there is little time left.<br>
  All that remains of our race, our civilization, are those that stand beside you now, and those corrupted on the surface below.<br>
  Our kind once stood as stewards of a galaxy full of promise. In our pride and division, we failed that sacred charge and fell to ruin.<br>
  The Khala, designed to bring unity, ultimately only aided those divisions. Its hope was a lie.<br>
  Today, that lie must come to its end, and with it, our prejudice and arrogance must become a thing of the past.<br>
  For we now fight in the belief that our kind has not seen its end.<br>
  That we protoss can stand bound by a belief in unity.<br>
  And that we protoss will forge a great and mighty new civilization!<br>
  Trust each other in the fight ahead. Strike as one will!<br>
  Let our last stand burn memory so bright that we will be known throughout eternity!
